# hello-world
First repository

I graduated with a Computer Science degree in 2001 and since have forotten everything there is to coding since my work history includes everything under the sun except programming. This field has changed a lot since I graduated. It is more engaging and I hope to be a proficient programmer in the very near future with the help of this site!
